# Description of the project  
This is a computer vision project. The objective is to develop a machine learning model capable of recognizing a person on a photograph.
  
The university gave us a set of pictures to conduct the project. These are protected and hence not available in this repository.  
  
We first applied a Principal Component Analysis followed by a K-nn model and a rule-based method to define whether we know the person on the picture or not.    
Then we optimized the distance metric threshold of this rule-based method.   
Finally, we compared the performances with and without PCA.  
  
# Results  
We reach an accuracy of around 99% using the pictures available. However, the pictures being very similar to one another, this result is to be nuanced. We would need more varied pictures of the people of the dataset to test our model more accurately.
