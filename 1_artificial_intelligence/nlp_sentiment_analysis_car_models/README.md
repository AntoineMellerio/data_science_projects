This NLP project proposed by Capgemini Invent consisted in conducting a complete analysis on the electrical car leasing market and proposing a strategy for the launch of a bank's new offer.  
  
The analysis was composed of three steps :  
- web scrapping of users comments from a car forum  
- preprocessing and wordclouds generations (notebook 1)  
- sentiment analysis (notebook 2)  
  
You will also find the final presentation retracing the whole study and final strategy proposed to the bank.
